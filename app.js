Exercise 3

Exercise 7
1. Evolve the starter Pokémon you added to your party earlier. Each starter Pokémon evolves into a specific one.
2. How would you replace the current starter Pokémon in your party with its evolved form?

Hint: 
- Pokemon 1: Bulbasaur evolves into Pokemon 2: Ivysaur
- Pokemon 4: Charmander evolves into Pokemon 5: Charmeleon
- Pokemon 7: Squirtle evolves into Pokemon 8: Wartortle
- Pokemon 25: Pikachu evolves into Pokemon 26: Raichu

More Hints: The existing starter Pokemon will be *replaced* in your party with the Pokemon it evolved into. When working with an array of objects, the splice() array method is ideal for replacing one element with another.

2. How will you find and update the quantity of pokeballs in the `game.items` array?

Tips:
For this exercise, it's okay to have a negative number of pokeballs.
After updating the method, call it and pass in a Pokemon object of your choice from the `pokemon` data to catch it.
Also, log the `game.items` array to confirm that the pokeball quantity is being decremented.

/*
Exercise 13
1. Create a `gymStatus` method in `game` to tally completed and incomplete gyms.
2. How will you iterate through the `gyms` array and update the tally? Remember to log the final tally.

This method should:
  - Not accept any arguments.
  - Initially create a constant `gymTally`, which is an object that has two 
    properties: `completed` and `incomplete`, both of which are initially set to 0.
  - Iterate through the objects in the `game.gyms` array and update the 
    properties on `gymTally` as follows: 
    - `completed` should count how many gyms in the array have a value of `true` 
      for their `completed` property. 
    - `incomplete` should count how many gyms in the array have a value of 
      `false` for their `completed` property.
  - Log the value of `gymTally`.
  - The method should not return anything.

For example, if five gym objects have a value of `true` on their `completed` property and three gym objects have a value of `false` on their `completed` property, the logged value would be: `{ completed: 5, incomplete: 3 }`.

1. Add a `partyCount` method to `game` that counts the number of Pokémon in your party.

Exercise 18
Add a new property to the `game` object called `collection` and initialize its value to an empty array.

  - Ensure that no more than six Pokemon can be in the party at any time. 
    Excess Pokemon should be placed in the `game.collection` array.
  - It's up to you how to distribute Pokemon in a situation where more than six 
    would be placed into the `game.party` array.

Again, for this exercise, it's okay to have a negative number of pokeballs.

After updating the method, use it by calling it and passing in a pokemon object of your choice from the `pokemon` data to catch it.

Also, log the `game.items` array to confirm that the pokeball quantity is being decremented.

Exercise 19
Copy the `catchPokemon` method that you just wrote above, and paste it below. The time has come to make it so that we cannot catch a Pokemon when we do not have any pokeballs to catch it with. 

Modify the method so that if there are no pokeballs a message will be displayed that there are not enough pokeballs to catch the desired Pokemon.

Also, ensure that the Pokemon isn't added to the `game.party` or the `game.collection`.

Exercise 20
Copy the `catchPokemon` method that you just wrote above, and paste it below. Modify is so that you can just pass in the name of a Pokemon instead of an entire object, and the method will look up the Pokemon from the data set for you.

The string passed in should be allowed to be any case (for example, if the string 'PiKacHU' is passed to the function, it should match to 'Pikachu' in the data set). 

If there is not a match, then return a string noting that the selected Pokemon does not exist. Ensure you do not decrement the pokeball count if an invalid Pokemon name is passed in, and also ensure that the Pokemon isn't added to the `game.party` or the `game.collection`.
